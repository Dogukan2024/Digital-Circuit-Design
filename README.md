# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Project

This project involves designing and implementing an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **VHDL** as part of a digital circuit design lab. An ALU is a combinational circuit capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations.

The ALU in this project supports **eight functions**, including:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Bitwise operations  
- Shift operations  

The design was built modularly in VHDL, simulated to verify correct functionality, and synthesized using Vivado. The final implementation was deployed on an FPGA, where the ALU outputs were displayed through onboard LEDs.

This repository contains the VHDL source files, simulation results, and related project materials.
